# Accessibility (a11y)
Similarly to building DOM for a web page, browsers build Accessibility Object Model (AOM). Accessibility API provides access to a web page via a screen-reader, a keyboard and other devices. It is important to create accessible interfaces to provide better user experience.

There are basic points to consider building accessible interface:
1. Structure of the page
    - headings
    - navigation
    - main content, etc.
2. Relations between elements
3. Appearance of the page (contrast colors, scalable font size)
4. Semantic markup
5. Description for interactive elements: buttons, inputs, forms, images, videos, etc.
    - `title` attribute
    - `alt` attribute for images
    - `<label>`-element for inputs
    - `aria-label`, `aria-labeledby`, `aria-describedby` [(good read)](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/accessibility/semantics-aria/aria-labels-and-relationships)
    - `aria-current` - attribute specifies the current (selected) item in the list
5. <details>
    <summary>Avoid using tabindex values greater than 0</summary>
    Tabindex is an html attribute which specifies if an element is focusable and what order in navigation sequence it has.

    Tabindex values:
    - **A negative value** (usually tabindex="-1") means that the element is not reachable via sequential keyboard navigation, but   could be focused with Javascript or visually by clicking with the mouse.
    - **tabindex="0"** means that the element should be focusable in sequential keyboard navigation.
    - **A positive value** means the element should be focusable in sequential keyboard navigation, with its order defined by the value of the number. If multiple elements share the same positive tabindex value, their order relative to each other follows their position in the document source. The maximum value for tabindex is 32767. If not specified, it takes the default value 0. 

    **Concerns**

    1. Avoid using tabindex values greater than 0. Doing so makes it difficult for people who rely on assistive technology to navigate and operate page content. Instead, **write the document with the elements in a logical sequence**.
    
    2. **Avoid using the tabindex attribute in conjunction with non-interactive content** to make something intended to be interactive focusable by keyboard input. An example of this would be using a `<div>` element to describe a button, instead of the `<button>` element.

6. Show focused element's highlight at least while navigating via keyboard
7. Use attribute `aria-hidden` to expose/hide non-interactive content from the accessibility API. Use cases:
   - purely decorative content, such as icons or images
   - duplicated content, such as repeated text
   - offscreen or collapsed content, such as menus, modal windows, popups, etc.
8. Use attribute `role` (`presentaion`, `banner`, etc. [learn more](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles))
9.  Add "Skip to the content" button to the pages. Usually this button is placed in the header and exposes when user is interacting with a keyboard or a screen-reader
10. Add a11y linting tool (e.g., eslint a11y plugin) to your project. This helps to follow common accessibility standards in the code
11. Use accessibility devtool tab in the browser to check the Accessibility Object Model (AOM)
