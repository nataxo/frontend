# Accessibility
Similarly to building DOM Tree browsers build Accessibility Tree of the page. Accessibility API provides access to the web page via screen reader, keyboard and other devices. It is fairly important to create accessible interfaces to provide better user experience.

There are basic points to consider building accessible interface:
1. Structure of the page
    - heading
    - navigation
2. Relations between elements
3. Appearance of the page (comfort contrast, scalable font size)
4. Semantic markup
5. Description for interactive elements: buttons, inputs, forms, images, videos, etc.
    - `title` attribute
    - `alt` attribute for images
    - `<label>`-element for inputs
    - `aria-label`, `aria-labeledby`, `aria-describedby` [(good read)](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/accessibility/semantics-aria/aria-labels-and-relationships)
6. Show focused element's outline at least while navigating via keyboard
7. Use attribute `aria-hidden` to expose/hide non-interactive content from the accessibility API. Use cases:
   - purely decorative content, such as icons or images
   - duplicated content, such as repeated text
   - offscreen or collapsed content, such as menus, modal windows, popups, etc.
8. Use attribute `role`
9. Add to the page "Jump to main content" button. Usually this button is placed in the header and exposes then user is interacting with a keyboard or a screen-reader
